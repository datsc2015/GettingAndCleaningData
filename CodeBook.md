###Description of the datasets(From web of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset)
'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
'features.txt': List of all features.
'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

###Description of Variables
1.Reads activity_labels.txt and names the six activities in the data set:
  1            WALKING
  2   WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  4            SITTING
  5           STANDING
  6             LAYING


2.Variables are similar as the following      
   1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X
   2 tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
   3 tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
   4  tBodyAcc-std()-X
   5  tBodyAcc-std()-Y
   6  tBodyAcc-std()-Z
